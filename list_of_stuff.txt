This is just a list of random stuff I need to organize my own messy mind.


Plans (new!):
OK- rewrite this entire thing in vanilla javascript

OK- start a repo

OK- rework game data variables into a huge object so I can work better later on the save and load

OK- make game autoload when page loads

OK- make sure interface is automatically updated with that (logic rework)

OK- save game and load game
. save game
. load game
. delete save
. buttons to do these things

OK- Implement milestones as a new and more versatile way to display new interface elements

TECHNICALLY OK WILL BE DEVELOPED LATER- Make an achievements object

OK- make the hire box maker function a more versatile and global worker hire function

OK- Finally implement box baker and the baked boxes

OK BUT NO UPGRADES YET- Implement pox wakers too!
. very expensive
. will be upgrade resource

- floor at source instead of on every interface update in the counterUpdater function

- testing utilities
. really need them now!!
. somewhere where I can hide buttons to help me add resources and stuff

- apparently our game is using about 10% CPU so what the hell. Look into optimization.

- add cats. They like boxes



- finish game's core features:
. counters
. workers
. values
. testing utilities
. upgrades
. some progression
. an alert box on the top or something to substitute window alerts

- rewrite everything using more modern javascript or typescript I have no clue

- use something else for the interface and learn some css preprocessor

- finally go use some goddamn framework like goddamn react or vue or angular
