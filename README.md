# Boxgame

A simple game about boxing.

This is a small project for learning and improving how I code in javascript.

## How to play the game

Currently, all you have to do is download this repo in a zip or clone it, and run locally on your browser by opening the index.html file!

Hopefully in the near future, this game will be properly published so you don't have to go through this hassle!

## Planned features

Lots of things, but I'm trying to keep it small and objective.

### Core game features

- [x] **resource counters:** box, baked box, waked pox
- [x] **workers:** for every of the above resources
- [x] **values:** a rate of progression
- [x] **testing utilities:** because we'll really need them
- [x] **upgrades:** to make stuff more fun!
- [ ] **some progression:** to give a direction to the player
- [ ] **an alert box on the top or something to substitute window alerts:** to make the game more pleasant.

### Bonus features

- [x] **an easter egg:** because why not!
- [ ] **new UI:** using something less canned than bootstrap, or at least learn a different visual library
- [ ] **cats:** cats love boxes! Would become an alternative progression maybe!
- [ ] **evilDoNot:** the voice in my head tells me stubborn people should have their save file deleted.
- [ ] **publish the game online using github pages or something:** ease of use

## Goals

- improve at javascript
- learn ES6
- or learn typescript
- learn sass, scss or less
- maybe redo everything to learn a framework
- have fun!
